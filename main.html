<p> I'm a Support Engineer turned Software Developer. I love building web applications and utilizing APIâ€™s. 
Traveling and coding harmonize well together in my life. When I'm not exploring new cities or creating a new web application, 
I'm binge watching TV with my husband, watching our kids play hockey, exercising, sewing, and cuddling our German Shepherds. </p>
